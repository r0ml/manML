<h1>Help for manML</h1>
<h2>Showing man pages</h2>
Enter the manual specification you wish to see, as you would the arguments to the <code>man</code> command -- either just the name of the page or the
section number and page separated by a blank.  The man page will be searched for in the default manpath and rendered using the new Swift-only renderer.
The <b>Settings</b> can be used to add additional search directories for manml.
<p>
Should a man page not render properly, you may toggle the <b>Legacy</b> switch and the rendering will use the legacy BSD mandoc implementation.
<p>
The magnifying glass icon in the upper right corner (or the key combination &#x2318;-F ) will let you search within the man page.

<p>
<code>manML</code> registers the <code>manml</code> scheme, so that one can also display a man page by opening a URL of the form: <code>manml:/page</code>
or <code>manml:/page/section</code>.  This can be done from the command line in <code>Terminal</code> with (e.g.) <code>open manml:/ls</code>.

<p>
If you are using <code>zsh</code> as your shell, you can evaluate
<blockquote>
<code> mm() { open manml:/$1 } </code>
</blockquote>
(which can be placed in your <code>.zshrc</code>)
after which

<blockquote><code>mm cat</code></blockquote>
will open the man page for <code>cat</code>, and
<blockquote><code>mm stat/2</code></blockquote>
will open the man page for <code>2 stat</code>.


<h2>Inspecting man pages</h2>
One can open any mandoc document by using the Finder and dragging the man page onto the <b>manml</b> main window.  This is useful when authoring or editing mandoc pages.

<p>
Additionally, if one clicks on the rendered man page, the bottom line of the window will show the mandoc source line which was used to generate that output.
The two buttons in the bottom right corner will scroll to the previous or following mandoc source lines in order to see additional context for the mandoc source.

The rendered HTML for the mandoc source can be exported by selecting the <b>Export HTML</b> action from the <b>File</b> menu.
