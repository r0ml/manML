# BUGS

- man page for awk does not render properly
- man page for c++ does not render properly
- ssh   (-D [bind_address:port] -- loses is because macroblock starts mid-line (twice) for Xo and Oo
- the places where safify needs to be called need to be identified.  Currently, there are places where it needs to be called and isn't.
- man applesingle:  .Fl h | Fl V  puts a double dash in front of the V -- and shouldn't
